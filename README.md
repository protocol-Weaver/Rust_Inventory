# Rust_Inventory
Inventory Handling System is a console-based application that allows users to manage their inventories of products using Rust. The application features:

- A secure authentication system that requires users to enter their username and password before accessing the inventory data.
- A vector-based data structure that stores the inventory information, such as product name, quantity, price, and category.
- A user-friendly interface that displays the inventory data in a table format on the console, and allows users to perform various operations, such as adding, deleting, editing, and searching products.
- A report generation function that creates a formatted and printable inventory report on the console, and saves it as a text file in the local directory.

The project aims to provide a simple and efficient way of handling inventories using Rust, a fast and reliable programming language. The project demonstrates the use of Rustâ€™s features, such as ownership, borrowing, error handling, and generics.

Our vision for the Rust Inventory Handling System is to revolutionize inventory management, prioritizing utmost security. We aim to redefine how inventories are handled by implementing robust security measures, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of crucial business data. By providing a secure and user-friendly platform, our project strives to empower businesses of all sizes, fostering trust and reliability in digital inventory management. We envision a future where companies can operate confidently, knowing their inventories are not only efficiently managed but also fortified against potential threats. The impact of our project lies in creating a new standard for secure, streamlined inventory handling.
